# week-2-code-challenge

BY: BERNARD KOECH

For this assignment, you will be working with a Magazine domain.



We have three models: Author, Article, and Magazine.



For our purposes, an Author has many Articles, a Magazine has many Articles, and Articles belong to both Author and Magazine.



Author - Magazine is a many to many relationship.
